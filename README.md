# advent-of-code-2020
My Python solutions for the advent of code 2020.
A nice challenge for everyday learning a coding language.
# Today I learned...
These are some things I learned along the way.
## Day 5
_General_
* Thanks to Björn Söderqvist aka cybear for the inspiration to track learning in the README.md file

_About Github_
* To add my 5 solutions to github.

_About Python_
* I wanted to practice the zip and map functions. I noticed that the [map()] creates a list containing a map object, instead the content of the mapping operation. Instead list(map()) works as I wanted.
