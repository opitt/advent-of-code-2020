# advent-of-code-2020
My Python solutions for the advent of code 2020.
A nice challenge for everyday learning a coding language.
# Today I learned...
These are some things I learned along the way.
## Day 5
_General_
* Thanks to Björn Söderqvist aka cybear for the inspiration to track learning in the README.md file

_About Github_
* Finally learned (again) to create a public github repo and add my daily solutions to it.

_About Python_
* I wanted to practice the zip and map functions. I noticed that the [map()] creates a list containing a map object, instead the content of the mapping operation. Instead list(map()) works as I wanted. 

## Day 6
_About Python_
* Learned to apply set operations on a list of sets
* Learned more about the unpacking \*

_About Github_
* Start to get familiar with markdown

_Resources_
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-sets/#operating-on-a-set)
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

_About Visual Studio Code_
* Learned to debug with VSC

## Day 7
_About Python_
* Using os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) to open a file in the same directory as the script. (KUDOS to @dogmatic69)

_General_
* Giving variables a meaningful name is an art. I think I changed my vars 5 times each, until it mades sense (to me).

## Day 8
_Python_
* Deep copy vs shallow copy: I knew about the difference, but used list.copy() without understanding, it is a shallow copy. Then I found the package copy with the deepcopy() function. Nice. Until I refactored a solution, that doesn't need to copy the list at all. Much better performance ...

## Day 9
_General_
* Reading the assignment is critical (really?). Smallest and biggest number ... I interpreted as lowest and highest index ... Wrong assumption. RTF rules!

## Day 10
_Python_
* Removing items from a list ... sometimes the simple things are just gone from the brain ... Thank you Google.
