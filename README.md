My Python solutions for the advent of code 2020.
A nice challenge for everyday learning a coding language.
# Today I learned...
These are some things I learned along the way.
## Day 5
_General_

_About Github_
* Finally learned (again) to create a public github repo and add my daily solutions to it.

_About Python_
